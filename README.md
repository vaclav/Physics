# Physics

Physical simulation description language built with MPS, allowing to describe objects and forces applied to them.

## Dependencies

### Languages

_Physics_ is based on [iets3.opensource](https://github.com/IETS3/iets3.opensource), which would require [mbeddr](http://mbeddr.com/).

### Runtime

There is currently a java runtime, based on [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [ode4j](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j). In order to fetch the dependencies use them in java simulations, see the [dependencies](./dependencies) folder, describing how to fetch the JAR dependencies.
